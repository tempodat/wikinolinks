# WikiNoLinks

WikiNoLinks is a Firefox extension designed to remove distracting links from Wikipedia pages. I made this to stop falling into Wikipedia rabbit-holes for hours at a time, under the philosophy that if I really want to learn about something, I should just google it. Publishing it in hopes it could help someone else :)

Once installed the extension icon should appear in your toolbar. Click it to toggle the link removal functionality on Wikipedia pages.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit PRs.
